# qualityprogram

This repository contains data and analysis code to reproduce results from the article **"Estimating the causal effect of a quality assurance program on quality of care in Germany"**.

## R scripts

R scripts to reproduce all analyses from the article can be found in the `/R` folder. Results are exported to `/results`.

## Data dictionary `resultsindicators.csv`

In the `/data` folder, the file `data_indicators.csv` contains all data used to produce the results. These are the annual observations of national-level quality indicator results in the observation period from 2013 to 2020 for all indicators in the analysis.
